## Dashboard 1

This dashboard displays the number of goals and assists for the best scores either in the whole league or in each team; the selection can be done throughout a window menu. The goals and assists are normalised per match. <br><br>
In the lower part of the dashboard is possible to see, when a specific team is selected, the score's trend over the weeks. <br>
If a player is clicked, his statistics will be displayed.

## Dashboard 2 

This dashboard displays the relation between the number of saves for each main team's goalkeeper, normalized per match, and the percentage of matches that the relative team played without receaving any goal. 
<br><br>
Even in this case the goalkeeper statistics will show if his icon is clicked.
